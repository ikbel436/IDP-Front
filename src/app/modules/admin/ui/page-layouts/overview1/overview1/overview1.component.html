            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This document provides a comprehensive overview of an AWS architecture that integrates various services such as Route 53,
                 CloudFront, Internet Gateway, VPC, NAT Gateway, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
                  The architecture is designed to offer a scalable, highly available, and secure environment for deploying containerized applications on AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Architecture Overview:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Route 53 for DNS management and routing traffic to various AWS resources. </strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>CloudFront for content delivery and caching to improve the performance of web applications.</strong></p>
                
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Internet Gateway to enable communication between the VPC and the internet.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>VPC with public and private subnets spread across two availability zones for isolating resources and managing network traffic.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>NAT Gateways for allowing resources in private subnets to access the internet while maintaining security.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or containers for improved availability and fault tolerance.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for managing containerized applications using Kubernetes.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Components :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Route 53 :
                    </strong></p>
                    Amazon Route 53 is a scalable domain name system (DNS) web service designed 
                    to route end-user requests to internet applications. It provides DNS resolution, health checking, and traffic routing capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>CloudFront :
                    </strong></p>
                    Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of web content to users by caching static 
                    and dynamic content at edge locations worldwide.
                     It enhances the performance and reliability of web applications by reducing latency and increasing data transfer speeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Internet Gateway :
                    </strong></p>
                    The Internet Gateway facilitates communication between the VPC and the internet,
                     allowing resources within the VPC to access the internet and receive incoming traffic from the internet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
                    </strong></p>
                    The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network defined by your specifications.
                     It enables you to customize the network configuration, such as IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Public Subnets :
                    </strong></p>
                    Public subnets are accessible from the internet and are typically used to deploy resources that require public accessibility,
                     such as web servers and load balancers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Private Subnets :
                    </strong></p>
                    Private subnets are isolated from the internet and are used to deploy resources that require additional security,
                     such as databases and application servers.
                     They can communicate with the internet via NAT Gateways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>NAT Gateway :
                    </strong></p>
                    NAT Gateways allow resources in private subnets to initiate outbound connections to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from the internet.
                     They provide secure and scalable internet access for resources in private subnets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) :
                    </strong></p>
                    Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances or containers,
                     to ensure high availability and fault tolerance of applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) :
                    </strong></p>
                    Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes.
                     It integrates with other AWS services for seamless application deployment and management.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Deployment Steps :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Create a CloudFront distribution to accelerate the delivery of web content.</strong></p>
                
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC to enable internet access.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Deploy NAT Gateways in each availability zone for outbound internet access from private subnets..</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Configure route tables to direct traffic to the Internet Gateway for public subnets and to NAT Gateways for private subnets.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Set up Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic to EKS nodes for containerized applications.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Deploy an Amazon EKS cluster for managing and orchestrating containers.</strong></p>
                   
                </li>
            </ul>
